# Kyosu
## Complex Without Complexes

Efficient and SIMD-aware computation for complex, quaternions and octonions.

Kyosu proposes unified treatment of Cayley-Dickson algebras on real numbers, for
numerical comptations.

Real numbers are implemented as float or double IEEE values and, as relying on
EVE library can use SIMD entry as well .
